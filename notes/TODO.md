# TODO List

## ðŸ“Œ Up-next Tasks
- Re-write the readme
- Implement the unfuzzy form of the KDE
- Add some flags for ease of logging
- Finish implementing the non-simplified version of the metric
- Do the experiments of the 1-pendulum
- Dig deeper into the theory, understand the metric and write thesis

## ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Finish implementing the variations of the 1-pendulum

## âœ… Completed
- Look at the results for the unactuated pendulum
- Take a look at the flags that you have, make them cleaner
- Fully separate the simulation and control algos

## ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas
- Write a loading management class and make saving based on algorithm
- Write a graphing class
- Write a trainer backend for RL controllers
- Encapsulate most of the complexity of the environment in own class
- Figure out how to make the env look nice with nice cameras
- Look into how to use your local version of skrl, since this one has the fix you made
- Make the way that controllers are accessed the same way that envs are accessed
- Add a bar showing the progress of episodes & duration ifo in terminal
- Sepparate the controllers from the simulation loop
- Create a managed env for
  - Double pendulum
  - Acrobot
  - Slip walker
  - Articulated walker
