# Dev Notes

## 25.03.25
- Starting setting up the project
- Copied the code from my previous project

# 15.04.25
- It's been a while since I continued the notes
- I learned that I have to specify the environment to JAX if I want it to actually use it.
- Tested JAX with SKRL
- Updated the documentation on how to use JAX and commands to install skrl when installing isaac
- Modified the scripts for a rudimentary saving and loading models based on my wishes
